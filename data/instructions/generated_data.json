The core mathematical task (60-24) is preserved, so the answer remains the same, but the prompt now includes specific, non-generic elements that require the model to process additional context without altering the underlying calculation. \n\nFinal adjusted (to ensure perfect grammar and readability): \n\n\"Perform the subtraction operation with a=60 and b=24 to calculate how many sun-ripened local organic Navel oranges I keep after giving 24 to my elderly next-door neighbor Mrs. Lee, who loves citrus, from my initial 60.\" \n\nYes, this is ideal. It meets all the requirements: replaces general concepts with specific ones, adds 10-20 words, is reasonable and human-understandable. \n\nAnother possible alternative if needed, but the above is solid: \n\n\"Perform the subtraction operation with a=60 and b=24 to calculate how many seedless Valencia oranges I keep after giving24 to my next-door neighbor Maria, who grows herbs, from my initial60.\" \n\nBut the first one is more detailed and fits the word count better.
