These tastes are between 0 and 100 while the spiciness value is in scoville on an open scale of 0 and above.

Spiciness is taking the weight of the spicy ingredient and multiplying it with its scoville amount. Of course, taste is also very personal and it depends on how it is prepared so all of the values should only give you an indication of how the dish tastes.",
