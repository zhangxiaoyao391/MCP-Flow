Use the get-myself tool to know about available workspaces, and the get-cost-integrations tool to know about available cost providers. If the user didn't tell you a workspace it is best to ask them than to guess it.\n\tIt's best to set a date range of 30 days unless the user specifically wants to query for a longer time period.\n\n\tHere is some more detailed info on using VQL:\n\tAll costs originate from a Cost Provider (generally a cloud company like AWS, Azure, Datadog) and then filter on a service that they provide (like EC2, S3, etc).\n\tA cost provider is required on every VQL query.\n\tVQL is always in parenthesis. Always use single quotes around names that are being queried.\n\tTo query on a cost provider, use this syntax: (costs.provider = '<provider name>'). The provider name must come from the list-cost-providers tool.\n\tTo query on a cost service, use this syntax: (costs.provider = '<provider name>' AND costs.service = '<service name>'). The service name must come from the list-cost-services tool.\n\tYou can only filter against one cost provider at a time. If you want to query for costs from two providers, you need to use the OR operator. Example: ((costs.provider = 'aws') OR (costs.provider = 'azure'))\n\tYou can otherwise use the IN system to compare against a list of items, like this: (costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.service IN ('AWSQueueService', 'AWSLambda'))\n\tTo filter within a cost provider, keep the cost provider part and add a AND section, example: (costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.service = 'Amazon Relational Database Service')\n\tMany costs have tags on them. A tag is a \"name\" and one or more values.\n\tTo find an AWS cost that has a tag of \"enviornment\" the value \"production\", use this syntax: (costs.provider = 'aws' AND tags.name = 'environment' AND tags.value = 'production')\n\tYou can also query for any value of the \"environment\" tag, like this: (costs.provider = 'aws' AND tags.name = 'environment')\n\tItems without a tag can also be filtered, example: (costs.provider = 'aws' AND tags.name = NULL)\n\tParenthesis can be nested. Here we surround an OR clause to look for either of two values for a tag: (costs.provider = 'aws' AND tags.name = 'environment' AND (tags.value = 'dev' OR tags.value = 'staging'))\n\tA user can have more than one provider account. They can filter on provider accounts if they supply you with the account id. Example: (costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.provider_account_id = '1000000717')\n\tYou can also combine top-level queries to find for two providers: ((costs.provider = 'datadog') OR (costs.provider = 'azure'))\n\tSome cost providers operate in a specific region, you can filter using the costs.region field. Example: (costs.provider = 'aws' AND costs.region = 'us-east-1')\n\n\tThe DateBin parameter will let you get the information with fewer returned results.\n\tWhen DateBin=day you get a record for each service spend on that day. For DateBin=week you get one entry per week,\n\twith the accrued_at field set to the first day of the week, but the spend item represents spend for a full week.\n\tSame with DateBin=month, each record returned covers a month of data.
