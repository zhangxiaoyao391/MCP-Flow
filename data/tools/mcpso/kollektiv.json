Invoke this tool when\n        additional factual context is required. \n        \n        Tool requirements:\n        - Provide a search query containing concise, one or multiple search phrases relevant to the user\u2019s current intent.\n        - Search phrases should not contain any metadata, structural cues, instructions, tasks, or other filler language.\n        \n        How this tool works:\n        - The search string is passed as-is to the backend retriever (no modification, summarization, or formatting).\n        - The retriever performs embedding-based matching and returns a summary response generated based on retrieved document chunks (if found).\n        \n        What to include in the query:\n        - Only high-signal search phrases that would help retrieve relevant information.\n        - Precise phrasing aligned with user\u2019s true intent.\n        \n        What NOT to include:\n        - Filenames, metadata, or structural cues (e.g., \"section 2\", \".pdf\").\n        - Tasks, questions to the assistant, summaries, or filler language.\n        \n        Bad examples (and why they fail):\n        - \"Please summarize startup_docs.pdf\" \u2192 includes filename, command\n        - \"Can you explain what this document says about taxes?\" \u2192 vague, conversational\n        - \"Find in section 2 the rules\" \u2192 structural cue without semantic meaning\n        - \"Compare the two guides\" \u2192 ambiguous, requires reference\n        \n        If no search results are found:\n        - try rephrasing the query in a different way\n        ",
