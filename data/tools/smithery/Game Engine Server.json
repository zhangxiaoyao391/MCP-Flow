        "description": "A tool for designing game mechanics and building games with Three.js and other open-source libraries.\nThis tool guides the game development process through structured thinking about mechanics, systems, and implementation with a focus on modern UI design.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Designing core game mechanics and player experience\n- Creating modern, engaging UI for your game\n- Planning game systems architecture\n- Implementing features with Three.js, Cannon.js, Ammo.js, etc.\n- Creating game loops and state management\n- Developing visual effects and custom shaders\n- Building physics systems and interactive elements\n- Creating player controls and responsive interfaces\n\nKey features:\n- Design modern UI components with automatic previews\n- Define game mechanics with balance and flow state considerations\n- Create player experience goals and emotion targets\n- Develop engagement hooks and retention mechanics\n- Design shader effects and visual enhancements\n- Supports branching for different game systems\n- Allows revision of game design decisions\n- Includes code snippets for implementation\n- Tracks performance considerations\n- Notes browser compatibility\n- Indicates implementation difficulty\n\nParameters explained:\n- thought: Current game design or implementation decision\n- nextThoughtNeeded: True if more design steps are needed\n- thoughtNumber: Current step in the design process\n- totalThoughts: Estimated total design steps needed\n- isRevision: If revising a previous game design decision\n- revisesThought: Which previous thought is being revised\n- branchFromThought: Starting point for a new system branch\n- branchId: Identifier for system branch (e.g., \"physics-system\")\n- gameComponent: Game system being worked on (e.g., \"physics\", \"rendering\")\n- libraryUsed: Library being utilized (e.g., \"threejs\", \"cannonjs\")\n- codeSnippet: Example code for implementation\n- performanceConsideration: Notes on performance impact\n- browserCompatibility: List of compatible browsers\n- difficulty: Implementation complexity (beginner/intermediate/advanced)\n- dependencies: Required dependencies\n- alternatives: Alternative approaches\n- uiComponents: UI elements with placement, interactivity, and accessibility\n- mechanics: Game mechanics including core, secondary, and progression\n- playerExperience: Emotional targets and engagement hooks\n- modernUI: UI style, theme, color scheme, and animations\n- shaders: Custom shader effects for visual enhancement\n- gameTitle: Title of the game (first thought only)\n- gameDescription: Brief description of the game (first thought only)\n\nYou should:\n1. Start with core game concept, mechanics, and UI vision\n2. Define target player experience and emotional goals\n3. Design modern UI components with accessibility in mind\n4. Specify game mechanics with balance considerations\n5. Break down implementation into components\n6. Include code snippets for key implementations\n7. Add visual enhancements with shader effects\n8. Consider performance across different devices\n9. Document Three.js implementation details\n10. Create a cohesive player journey and progression system\n11. Iterate until game design is complete",
