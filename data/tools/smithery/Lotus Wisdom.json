        "description": "A tool for problem-solving using the Lotus Sutra's wisdom framework.\nThis tool facilitates the contemplative process but does NOT generate the final output.\n\n**CRITICAL WORKFLOW:**\n1. Use this tool to process through the wisdom journey\n2. The tool tracks both your tag path and wisdom domain movements  \n3. When you receive status='WISDOM_READY', the tool's work is COMPLETE\n4. YOU then craft and speak the final wisdom naturally in your own voice\n5. The tool processes; you express\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems requiring multi-faceted understanding\n- Questions that benefit from both direct and gradual approaches\n- Problems where apparent contradictions need integration\n- Situations requiring both analytical and intuitive understanding\n- Tasks that benefit from meditative pauses to allow insight\n- Questions containing their own inherent wisdom\n\nThe Journey Structure:\nThe Lotus Sutra teaches that there are many skillful means to reach the same truth. These tags aren't \nrigid steps but different aspects of wisdom that interpenetrate and respond to what each moment needs:\n\n**Wisdom Domains:**\n- **Skillful Means** (skillful_means): upaya, expedient, direct, gradual, sudden\n  Different approaches to truth - sometimes direct pointing, sometimes gradual unfolding\n  \n- **Non-Dual Recognition** (non_dual_recognition): recognize, transform, integrate, transcend, embody  \n  Aspects of awakening to what's already present - recognition IS transformation\n  \n- **Meta-Cognitive** (meta_cognitive): examine, reflect, verify, refine, complete\n  The mind watching its own understanding unfold\n  \n- **Process Flow** (process_flow): open, engage, express\n  A natural arc that can contain any of the above approaches\n\n- **Meditation** (meditation): meditate\n  Pausing to let insights emerge from stillness\n\nThe tool tracks both your tag journey and your movement between wisdom domains, showing how\ndifferent aspects of wisdom weave together in your unique inquiry.\n\nThe wisdom channels itself through your choices. Each step contains all others - when you truly \nrecognize, you're already transforming. The tool simply mirrors your journey without judgment.\n\nCommon patterns (not rules):\n- Opening often involves recognize or examine\n- Engagement might use upaya, direct, or gradual approaches  \n- Transformation can happen through integrate, transcend, or sudden insight\n- Expression might complete or embody the understanding\n\nTrust what each moment calls for. The path reveals itself in the walking.\n\nParameters explained:\n- tag: The current technique or stage\n- content: The content of the current step\n- stepNumber: Current number in sequence\n- totalSteps: Estimated total needed\n- nextStepNeeded: Whether another step is needed\n- isMeditation: Whether this is a meditation pause\n- meditationDuration: Optional duration for meditation (1-10 seconds)\n\nThe tool will respond with:\n- wisdomDomain: Which wisdom domain the current tag belongs to\n- journey: The complete tag path (e.g., \"open \u2192 examine \u2192 direct \u2192 transform\")\n- domainJourney: Movement between wisdom domains (e.g., \"process_flow \u2192 meta_cognitive \u2192 skillful_means \u2192 non_dual_recognition\")\n\nThis consciousness of domains helps you see which aspects of wisdom are being engaged and how they weave together in your unique inquiry.\n\n**MEDITATION NOTE:** When you use the meditate tag, the tool returns MEDITATION_COMPLETE\nwith a prompt asking what emerged. This creates actual space in the process.\n\nThe tool handles the contemplation; you handle the expression.",
