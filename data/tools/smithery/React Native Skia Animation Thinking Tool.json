        "description": "A specialized tool for solving React Native Skia animation problems through structured thinking.\nThis tool helps analyze animation challenges and design solutions specifically for React Native Skia.\nEach thought can build on previous insights, explore different animation techniques, or revise approaches as understanding deepens.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex animation problems for React Native Skia\n- Planning performant animations with Reanimated integration\n- Designing custom visual effects and transitions\n- Optimizing animation performance on mobile devices\n- Solving specific animation challenges like gesture response, dynamic paths, or timing issues\n- Planning canvas-based animations with proper memory management\n- Designing complex interactive animations\n\nKey features:\n- You can explore various React Native Skia animation techniques\n- You can consider performance implications of different approaches\n- You can revise previous thoughts as animation requirements become clearer\n- You can branch into different animation strategies\n- You can specify code snippets that demonstrate techniques\n- You can describe visual effects and results\n- You can adjust your thinking as you progress through the problem\n\nParameters explained:\n- thought: Your current thinking step about the animation problem\n- nextThoughtNeeded: True if you need more thinking steps\n- thoughtNumber: Current number in sequence\n- totalThoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed\n- isRevision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking\n- revisesThought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered\n- branchFromThought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point\n- branchId: Identifier for the current branch (if any)\n- needsMoreThoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed\n- animationTechnique: The Skia animation technique being considered (e.g., \"path interpolation\", \"reanimated integration\", \"canvas animations\")\n- performanceConsideration: Notes on performance implications of the technique\n- visualEffect: Description of the visual result expected\n- codeSnippet: Example code showing how to implement the technique\n\nYou should:\n1. Start by clearly understanding the animation problem\n2. Break down the problem into logical steps\n3. Explore appropriate React Native Skia techniques for each step\n4. Consider integration with Reanimated when appropriate\n5. Address performance concerns specific to mobile animation\n6. Provide specific code examples that demonstrate techniques\n7. Revise approaches if better solutions become apparent\n8. Consider edge cases and potential issues\n9. Design with a performance-first mindset\n10. Remember that React Native Skia runs on the UI thread\n11. Ensure the solution provides a smooth, visually appealing result",
