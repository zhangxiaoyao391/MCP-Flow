You must provide 'originalRequest' and 'tasks', and optionally 'splitDetails'.\n\nThis tool initiates a new workflow for handling a user's request. The workflow is as follows:\n1. Use 'request_planning' to register a request and its tasks.\n2. After adding tasks, you MUST use 'get_next_task' to retrieve the first task. A progress table will be displayed.\n3. Use 'get_next_task' to retrieve the next uncompleted task.\n4. **IMPORTANT:** After marking a task as done, the assistant MUST NOT proceed to another task without the user's approval. The user must explicitly approve the completed task using 'approve_task_completion'. A progress table will be displayed before each approval request.\n5. Once a task is approved, you can proceed to 'get_next_task' again to fetch the next pending task.\n6. Repeat this cycle until all tasks are done.\n7. After all tasks are completed (and approved), 'get_next_task' will indicate that all tasks are done and that the request awaits approval for full completion.\n8. The user must then approve the entire request's completion using 'approve_request_completion'. If the user does not approve and wants more tasks, you can again use 'request_planning' to add new tasks and continue the cycle.\n\nThe critical point is to always wait for user approval after completing each task and after all tasks are done, wait for request completion approval. Do not proceed automatically.",
