There are limited clinical\\n  trial data describing the efficacy of osimertinib combined with MET\\n  inhibition in EGFR T790M-mutant NSCLC patients with Met amplification.\\n\\n  Patient concerns:\\n\\n  A non-smoking 53-year-old male patient with lung adenocarcinoma\\n  underwent gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib combined with crizotinib\\n  treatment and developed different EGFR resistance mutations.\\n\\n  Diagnoses:\\n\\n  The patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma (stage cT4N2M0,\\n  IIIB). After resistance to the therapy targeting EGFR exon 21 L858R\\n  point mutation, T790 M mutation was detected in liquid biopsy and Met\\n  amplification was detected via tissue biopsy by next-generation\\n  sequencing (NGS).\\n\\n  Interventions:\\n\\n  The patient received systemic treatments, including chemotherapy,\\n  gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib combined with crizotinib.\\n\\n  Outcomes:\\n\\n  The patient died of multisystem organ failure and had an overall\\n  survival of 24 months.\\n\\n  Lessons:\\n\\n  Although osimertinib combined with crizotinib therapy showed dramatic\\n  tumor shrinkage in both the primary tumor and bone metastasis to an EGFR\\n  T790M-mutant NSCLC patient with MET amplification, the progression-free\\n  survival (PFS) was only two months.\\nFull Text:\\n  Introduction\\n\\n  Advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR gene mutations is closely\\n  related to the clinical efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor\\n  tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs), but the outcomes are limited by\\n  acquired resistance. The EGFR exon 20 T790 M mutation accounts for 50%\\n  to 60% of the resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs, followed\\n  by bypass pathway activation (e.g., MET or ERRB2 amplification,\\n  mutations in BRAF and PIK3CA), and lineage shifts (e.g., small-cell\\n  transformation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition). 'Third-\\n  generation' EGFR TKIs, such as osimertinib, are highly effective in\\n  EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients harboring the EGFR T790 M mutation.\\n  Nevertheless, resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs can still develop\\n  through further mutations in EGFR and the activation of alternative\\n  pathways. With the development of high-throughput NGS-based liquid\\n  biopsy technology, additional mechanisms, such as EGFR exon 20 C797S,\\n  EGFR L718Q, and EGFR exon 18 G724S mutations were observed. NGS-based\\n  liquid biopsy testing overcomes spatial heterogeneity and can\\n  dynamically monitor tumor genomic evolution and guide decision-making\\n  for treatment strategies in a minimally invasive manner.\\n\\n  Here, we present the case of an EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC patient who\\n  acquired resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs in a short\\n  time. There were different results of the NGS tests between blood\\n  samples and tumor tissue samples at the same time, that EGFR T790 M\\n  mutation was only found in blood and Met amplification was only found in\\n  tumor tissue. Although there are limited clinical trial data describing\\n  the efficacy of osimertinib combined with MET inhibition in patients\\n  with EGFR T790M-mutant NSCLC, outcomes in a real-world setting are\\n  useful to inform clinical practice. Despite disease progression after\\n  only 3 months, the patient experienced substantial symptomatic\\n  improvement and dramatic tumor regression following osimertinib combined\\n  with crizotinib therapy.\\n\\n  The profile of treatments, images and NGS results of the patient. (A)\\n  Initial Chemotherapy of cisplatin/pemetrexed had a good response to\\n  tumor but caused intolerable adverse reactions. The first NGS suggested\\n  EGFR 21 L858R mutation. (B) The PFS of first-generation EGFR-TKI\\n  gefitinib was only 5 months. (C) The second NGS suggested there was no\\n  T790 M mutation. And the second-generation EGFR-TKI afatinib was\\n  ineffective. (D) The PFS of secondary chemotherapy and plus Bevacizumab\\n  was only 4 months. (E) The third NGS suggested EGFR T790 M mutation was\\n  only in blood and Met amplification was only in tumor tissue.\\n  Osimertinib combined with crizotinib showed dramatic tumor shrinkage.\\n  (F) The PFS of osimertinib combined with crizotinib was only 3 months.\\n  (G) Palliative care for 4 months. p(H) Brain metastasis and the fourth\\n  NGS of EGFR L858R, T790 M/C797S (cis), and MET L1195 V mutations.\\n\\n  Discussion\\n\\n  The most common acquired resistance mechanism against the first- and\\n  second-generation TKIs in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients might be the T790 M\\n  mutation, and other resistant subclones may also coexist in these\\n  patients. Amplification of the MET proto-oncogene accounts for 5-20% of\\n  acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. strong expression of c-Met is\\n  associated with poor prognosis of NSCLCs. In this case, we analyzed the\\n  potential resistance to EGFR mutations during sequential use of the\\n  first- and second-generation TKIs (gefitinib and afatinib) in an\\n  advanced lung cancer patient. EGFR T790 M was detected in plasma, and\\n  MET amplification was found in the tumor at the time of resistance to\\n  afatinib. Previous studies have shown that co-occurring genomic events\\n  are detected in up to 93% of EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. Tumor biopsies have a\\n  greater depth of molecular characterization; however, they may be\\n  spatially limited to a minute fragment of patients' overall cancer\\n  burden. The ctDNA comes from multiple disease sites and may illustrate\\n  coexistent subclones; thus, liquid biopsies might provide different\\n  information about tumor heterogeneity.\\n\\n  MET amplification can drive human epidermal growth factor receptor 3\\n  (ERBB 3)-dependent PI3K activation; therefore, it may be involved in\\n  EGFR-TKI resistance. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that in EGFR\\n  T790M-mutant NSCLCs, aberrant c-Met activity can confer resistance to\\n  third-generation EGFR TKIs. This suggests that inhibition of both c-Met\\n  and EGFR T790 M is effective in preventing the growth of EGFR\\n  T790M-mutant NSCLCs with c-Met amplification. A recent case report\\n  showed that combinatorial treatment with a first/third-generation EGFR-\\n  TKI and crizotinib resulted in partial responses in two patients with\\n  newly acquired MET amplification after osimertinib resistance. Moreover,\\n  in a phase I/II trial of capmatinib (a small-molecule MET receptor TKI)\\n  combined with gefitinib in EGFR-mutated tumors after EGFR inhibitor\\n  treatment failed NSCLC, the ORR was 47% in patients with MET gene copy\\n  number (GCN) >= 6 subgroup. In the TATTON study, the objective response\\n  rate was 44% in the group treated with osimertinib combined with\\n  savolitinib (MET-TKI). Our case confirmed these observations and\\n  revealed that EGFR T790 M mutation and MET amplification in different\\n  samples can clinically document coexistent, genetically distinct\\n  subpopulations differentially responding as predicted by their genotype\\n  in real time to therapies. Although the progression-free survival (PFS)\\n  of osimertinib in combination with crizotinib was only 3 months, the\\n  patient experienced substantial symptomatic improvement in chest pain\\n  and achieved partial responses.\\n\\n  Further liquid biopsy provided insight into clonal dynamics after\\n  treatment failure with osimertinib combined with crizotinib, emergence\\n  T790 M/C797S. A previous study reported that the EGFR exon 20 C797S\\n  mutation was a major resistance mechanism to osimertinib. C797S may\\n  disrupt the key cysteine residue at the drug-binding site. Although\\n  fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs such as EAI045 have been developed for the\\n  C797S mutation, there are currently no available drugs against T790\\n  M/C797S in the clinic.\\n\\n  PD-L1 high expression (80%) was detected after treatment with the first-\\n  and second-generation TKIs in this patient. Some studies have shown that\\n  PD-L1 high expression in tumors may predict a poor response to targeted\\n  therapy in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs. The role of immunotherapy as a second-\\n  line therapy in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs after EGFR-TKIs is still\\n  controversial, because there is no overall survival improvement over\\n  docetaxel. The recent results of the IMpower150 phase III trial\\n  indicated that patients in the EGFR-mutated subgroup could benefit from\\n  bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial\\n  growth factor (VEGF), chemotherapy, and atezolizumab after EGFR-TKIs.\\n\\n  Conclusion\\n\\n  Herein, our report represents a remarkably interesting case of the\\n  complexity and heterogeneity of EGFR mutations along the treatment\\n  course of different TKIs via NGS-based tumor tissue and liquid biopsy.\\n  The patient underwent gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib combined with\\n  crizotinib treatment, and developed different EGFR resistance mutations.\\n  In conclusion, although osimertinib combined with crizotinib showed\\n  dramatic tumor shrinkage both in primary tumor and bone metastasis in\\n  EGFR T790M-mutant NSCLC patients with MET amplification, more studies\\n  should be performed to confirm the clinical benefit in PFS and overall\\n  survival. Repeated NGS testing during treatment may provide insight into\\n  clonal evolution and help to select the optimal drugs to achieve better\\n  overall clinical outcomes.\\nPubmed Url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34397683/\\nPmc Url: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8322536/\\nAuthors: Li D, Gui Q, Xu C, Shen M, Chen K\\n\"}], \"isError\": false}"

There are limited clinical\\n  trial data describing the efficacy of osimertinib combined with MET\\n  inhibition in EGFR T790M-mutant NSCLC patients with Met amplification.\\n\\n  Patient concerns:\\n\\n  A non-smoking 53-year-old male patient with lung adenocarcinoma\\n  underwent gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib combined with crizotinib\\n  treatment and developed different EGFR resistance mutations.\\n\\n  Diagnoses:\\n\\n  The patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma (stage cT4N2M0,\\n  IIIB). After resistance to the therapy targeting EGFR exon 21 L858R\\n  point mutation, T790 M mutation was detected in liquid biopsy and Met\\n  amplification was detected via tissue biopsy by next-generation\\n  sequencing (NGS).\\n\\n  Interventions:\\n\\n  The patient received systemic treatments, including chemotherapy,\\n  gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib combined with crizotinib.\\n\\n  Outcomes:\\n\\n  The patient died of multisystem organ failure and had an overall\\n  survival of 24 months.\\n\\n  Lessons:\\n\\n  Although osimertinib combined with crizotinib therapy showed dramatic\\n  tumor shrinkage in both the primary tumor and bone metastasis to an EGFR\\n  T790M-mutant NSCLC patient with MET amplification, the progression-free\\n  survival (PFS) was only two months.\\nFull Text:\\n  Introduction\\n\\n  Advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR gene mutations is closely\\n  related to the clinical efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor\\n  tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs), but the outcomes are limited by\\n  acquired resistance. The EGFR exon 20 T790 M mutation accounts for 50%\\n  to 60% of the resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs, followed\\n  by bypass pathway activation (e.g., MET or ERRB2 amplification,\\n  mutations in BRAF and PIK3CA), and lineage shifts (e.g., small-cell\\n  transformation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition). 'Third-\\n  generation' EGFR TKIs, such as osimertinib, are highly effective in\\n  EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients harboring the EGFR T790 M mutation.\\n  Nevertheless, resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs can still develop\\n  through further mutations in EGFR and the activation of alternative\\n  pathways. With the development of high-throughput NGS-based liquid\\n  biopsy technology, additional mechanisms, such as EGFR exon 20 C797S,\\n  EGFR L718Q, and EGFR exon 18 G724S mutations were observed. NGS-based\\n  liquid biopsy testing overcomes spatial heterogeneity and can\\n  dynamically monitor tumor genomic evolution and guide decision-making\\n  for treatment strategies in a minimally invasive manner.\\n\\n  Here, we present the case of an EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC patient who\\n  acquired resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs in a short\\n  time. There were different results of the NGS tests between blood\\n  samples and tumor tissue samples at the same time, that EGFR T790 M\\n  mutation was only found in blood and Met amplification was only found in\\n  tumor tissue. Although there are limited clinical trial data describing\\n  the efficacy of osimertinib combined with MET inhibition in patients\\n  with EGFR T790M-mutant NSCLC, outcomes in a real-world setting are\\n  useful to inform clinical practice. Despite disease progression after\\n  only 3 months, the patient experienced substantial symptomatic\\n  improvement and dramatic tumor regression following osimertinib combined\\n  with crizotinib therapy.\\n\\n  The profile of treatments, images and NGS results of the patient. (A)\\n  Initial Chemotherapy of cisplatin/pemetrexed had a good response to\\n  tumor but caused intolerable adverse reactions. The first NGS suggested\\n  EGFR 21 L858R mutation. (B) The PFS of first-generation EGFR-TKI\\n  gefitinib was only 5 months. (C) The second NGS suggested there was no\\n  T790 M mutation. And the second-generation EGFR-TKI afatinib was\\n  ineffective. (D) The PFS of secondary chemotherapy and plus Bevacizumab\\n  was only 4 months. (E) The third NGS suggested EGFR T790 M mutation was\\n  only in blood and Met amplification was only in tumor tissue.\\n  Osimertinib combined with crizotinib showed dramatic tumor shrinkage.\\n  (F) The PFS of osimertinib combined with crizotinib was only 3 months.\\n  (G) Palliative care for 4 months. p(H) Brain metastasis and the fourth\\n  NGS of EGFR L858R, T790 M/C797S (cis), and MET L1195 V mutations.\\n\\n  Discussion\\n\\n  The most common acquired resistance mechanism against the first- and\\n  second-generation TKIs in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients might be the T790 M\\n  mutation, and other resistant subclones may also coexist in these\\n  patients. Amplification of the MET proto-oncogene accounts for 5-20% of\\n  acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. strong expression of c-Met is\\n  associated with poor prognosis of NSCLCs. In this case, we analyzed the\\n  potential resistance to EGFR mutations during sequential use of the\\n  first- and second-generation TKIs (gefitinib and afatinib) in an\\n  advanced lung cancer patient. EGFR T790 M was detected in plasma, and\\n  MET amplification was found in the tumor at the time of resistance to\\n  afatinib. Previous studies have shown that co-occurring genomic events\\n  are detected in up to 93% of EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. Tumor biopsies have a\\n  greater depth of molecular characterization; however, they may be\\n  spatially limited to a minute fragment of patients' overall cancer\\n  burden. The ctDNA comes from multiple disease sites and may illustrate\\n  coexistent subclones; thus, liquid biopsies might provide different\\n  information about tumor heterogeneity.\\n\\n  MET amplification can drive human epidermal growth factor receptor 3\\n  (ERBB 3)-dependent PI3K activation; therefore, it may be involved in\\n  EGFR-TKI resistance. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that in EGFR\\n  T790M-mutant NSCLCs, aberrant c-Met activity can confer resistance to\\n  third-generation EGFR TKIs. This suggests that inhibition of both c-Met\\n  and EGFR T790 M is effective in preventing the growth of EGFR\\n  T790M-mutant NSCLCs with c-Met amplification. A recent case report\\n  showed that combinatorial treatment with a first/third-generation EGFR-\\n  TKI and crizotinib resulted in partial responses in two patients with\\n  newly acquired MET amplification after osimertinib resistance. Moreover,\\n  in a phase I/II trial of capmatinib (a small-molecule MET receptor TKI)\\n  combined with gefitinib in EGFR-mutated tumors after EGFR inhibitor\\n  treatment failed NSCLC, the ORR was 47% in patients with MET gene copy\\n  number (GCN) >= 6 subgroup. In the TATTON study, the objective response\\n  rate was 44% in the group treated with osimertinib combined with\\n  savolitinib (MET-TKI). Our case confirmed these observations and\\n  revealed that EGFR T790 M mutation and MET amplification in different\\n  samples can clinically document coexistent, genetically distinct\\n  subpopulations differentially responding as predicted by their genotype\\n  in real time to therapies. Although the progression-free survival (PFS)\\n  of osimertinib in combination with crizotinib was only 3 months, the\\n  patient experienced substantial symptomatic improvement in chest pain\\n  and achieved partial responses.\\n\\n  Further liquid biopsy provided insight into clonal dynamics after\\n  treatment failure with osimertinib combined with crizotinib, emergence\\n  T790 M/C797S. A previous study reported that the EGFR exon 20 C797S\\n  mutation was a major resistance mechanism to osimertinib. C797S may\\n  disrupt the key cysteine residue at the drug-binding site. Although\\n  fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs such as EAI045 have been developed for the\\n  C797S mutation, there are currently no available drugs against T790\\n  M/C797S in the clinic.\\n\\n  PD-L1 high expression (80%) was detected after treatment with the first-\\n  and second-generation TKIs in this patient. Some studies have shown that\\n  PD-L1 high expression in tumors may predict a poor response to targeted\\n  therapy in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs. The role of immunotherapy as a second-\\n  line therapy in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs after EGFR-TKIs is still\\n  controversial, because there is no overall survival improvement over\\n  docetaxel. The recent results of the IMpower150 phase III trial\\n  indicated that patients in the EGFR-mutated subgroup could benefit from\\n  bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial\\n  growth factor (VEGF), chemotherapy, and atezolizumab after EGFR-TKIs.\\n\\n  Conclusion\\n\\n  Herein, our report represents a remarkably interesting case of the\\n  complexity and heterogeneity of EGFR mutations along the treatment\\n  course of different TKIs via NGS-based tumor tissue and liquid biopsy.\\n  The patient underwent gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib combined with\\n  crizotinib treatment, and developed different EGFR resistance mutations.\\n  In conclusion, although osimertinib combined with crizotinib showed\\n  dramatic tumor shrinkage both in primary tumor and bone metastasis in\\n  EGFR T790M-mutant NSCLC patients with MET amplification, more studies\\n  should be performed to confirm the clinical benefit in PFS and overall\\n  survival. Repeated NGS testing during treatment may provide insight into\\n  clonal evolution and help to select the optimal drugs to achieve better\\n  overall clinical outcomes.\\nPubmed Url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34397683/\\nPmc Url: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8322536/\\nAuthors: Li D, Gui Q, Xu C, Shen M, Chen K\\n\"}], \"isError\": false}"

Excessive host inflammatory responses contribute to poor\\n  outcomes. Corticosteroid therapy may provide benefit; however, the\\n  optimal dosage remains unclear, and it is uncertain whether all\\n  etiologies (e.g., Pneumocystis jirovecii, adenovirus, influenza) of sCAP\\n  can benefit equally.\\n\\n  This study will first establish a comprehensive trial platform based on\\n  a prospective sCAP cohort, embedding a randomized, multifactorial,\\n  adaptive platform trial (APT). The response-adaptive design will\\n  increase the likelihood of patients being assigned to more effective\\n  treatment arms, while Bayesian statistical modeling will dynamically\\n  assess the efficacy of interventions, allowing early achievement of\\n  study endpoints.\\n\\n  At the starting stage, two pathogen-specific APTs will be conducted,\\n  focusing on adenovirus- and pneumocystis Jirovecii-induced sCAP.\\n  Patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed diagnoses of adenovirus or\\n  pneumocystis Jirovecii-associated sCAP will be randomized into a control\\n  group or one of two corticosteroid dosage groups. The primary endpoint\\n  will be 28-day all-cause mortality. Completion of these APTs will\\n  provide a theoretical basis for novel anti-inflammatory strategies in\\n  sCAP.\\n\\n  Moreover, this platform will serve as an essential research\\n  infrastructure for the efficient evaluation of new therapeutic options\\n  in the event of emerging or re-emerging respiratory pathogens causing\\n  sCAP in the future.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Severe Community-acquired Pneumonia (sCAP)\\nInterventions:\\n  DRUG: Low dose steroids|DRUG: Moderate dose steroids|DRUG: Saline (0.9%\\n  NaCl)\\nPhases: PHASE2|PHASE3\\nEnrollment: 1500\\nStudy Type: INTERVENTIONAL\\nStudy Design:\\n  Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE\\n  (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT\\nStart Date: 2025-09-08\\nCompletion Date: 2035-12-31\\n\\n# Record 3\\nNct Number: NCT05348148\\nStudy Title:\\n  Comparison of the Effects for Lightening the Shiners Among Different\\n  Treatments for Rhinitis\\nStudy Url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05348148\\nStudy Status: RECRUITING\\nBrief Summary:\\n  Background: Shiners are caused when blood and other fluids accumulate in\\n  the infraorbital groove. It develops resulting from lots of problems. In\\n  patient with rhinitis, either allergic rhinitis or non-allergic\\n  rhinitis, shiners are believed to be caused by venous stasis resulting\\n  from nasal congestion. This study is aiming that comparison of the\\n  effectiveness of treatment of rhinitis (either allergic rhinitis or non-\\n  allergic rhinitis) to lighten not only the rhinitis but also the\\n  shiners. Randomized control studies.\\n\\n  Design: The investigators will recruit children (6-12 y/0), adolescent\\n  (13-18 y/o), or adults (19-65 y/o) with either allergic rhinitis or non-\\n  allergic rhinitis, and patients will be randomly assigned to groups\\n  (oral antihistamine, combined nasal corticosteroids with oral\\n  antihistamine, combined nasal corticosteroids with oral antihistamine\\n  plus nasal decongestant, combined nasal corticosteroids with oral\\n  antihistamine plus nasal irrigation, combined oral antihistamine with\\n  nasal irrigation, or nasal antihistamine only). Digital image will be\\n  recorded and analyzed to compare the change of shiners between before\\n  and after treatment for rhinitis. The clinical data were collected\\n  including patient's data, history, laboratory data, Pediatric\\n  Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ), Adolescent\\n  Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (AdolRQLQ), or mini\\n  Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (mini-RQLQ), and\\n  medications. The primary outcome is to answer whether the levels of\\n  shiners can be alleviated by using therapies in patient with rhinitis.\\n  And the secondary outcome is to figure out which therapies work most\\n  effectively.\\n\\n  Keywords: allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, shiners, nasal\\n  corticosteroids\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Allergic Rhinitis|Vasomotor Rhinitis\\nInterventions:\\n  DRUG: Oral Levocetirizine|DRUG: Combined Intranasal Mometasone Furoate\\n  with oral Levocetirizine|DRUG: Combined Intranasal Mometasone Furoate\\n  with oral Levocetirizine plus intranasal Oxymetazoline\\nPhases: NA\\nEnrollment: 450\\nStudy Type: INTERVENTIONAL\\nStudy Design:\\n  Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE\\n  (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT\\nStart Date: 2020-06-16\\nCompletion Date: 2032-03-31\\n\\n# Record 4\\nNct Number: NCT07079150\\nStudy Title:\\n  Real-world Study Evaluating the Long-term Outcomes of Pegylated\\n  Interferon \\u03b1-2b Treatment in the Families With Clusters of HBV Infection\\n  and Unfavorable Prognosis - A Prospective, Controlled, Multicenter,\\n  Cohort Study\\nStudy Url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07079150\\nStudy Status: RECRUITING\\nBrief Summary:\\n  Chronic hepatitis B can develop into cirrhosis and liver cancer, which\\n  seriously endangers the life and health of people. In China, HBV is\\n  mainly transmitted from mother to child, showing the phenomenon of\\n  family clusters. Similarly, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma occur\\n  in familial clusters. Familial clusters of HBV infection with\\n  unfavorable prognoses refers to HBV-infected patients from two\\n  consecutive generations of blood relatives, with at least one family\\n  member diagnosed with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis or hepatocellular\\n  carcinoma (HCC). Previous family investigations have shown that the risk\\n  and harm of HBV-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are\\n  significantly higher in families with familial clusters of HBV infection\\n  with unfavorable prognoses than in the general population.\\n\\n  Currently, antiviral drugs used for CHB mainly include nucleoside\\n  analogues (NAs) and interferon-alpha (mainly pegylated interferon-alpha,\\n  Peg IFN). NAs mainly inhibits viral replication by blocking the reverse\\n  transcription process, but it cannot effectively inhibit the expression\\n  of viral proteins such as HBsAg, and rarely achieves clinical cure.\\n  Multiple clinical studies have shown that the use of NAs reduces the\\n  incidence of cirrhosis decompensation, HCC, and death in patients with\\n  CHB compared to untreated or placebo-treated patients. Despite long-term\\n  treatment with first-line NAs drugs, CHB patients continue to be at risk\\n  of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Peg IFN \\u03b1-2b injection is the\\n  first-line drug of choice for antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis\\n  B, and its main mechanism of action includes anti-HBV, anti-fibrosis,\\n  anti-tumor and regulation of immune response. In 2024, a randomized\\n  controlled multicenter study showed that Peg IFN \\u03b1-2b combined with NAs\\n  therapy could effectively prevent hepatocellular carcinoma in CHB\\n  patients. There is sufficient evidence in clinical practice that long-\\n  term antiviral therapy, whether NAs or Peg IFN \\u03b1-2b, reduces the risk of\\n  cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death in patients with CHB. In\\n  conclusion, early antiviral therapy can reduce the risk of developing\\n  hepatitis B cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in CHB patients with\\n  familial clusters of HBV infection with unfavorable prognoses.\\n\\n  The goal of this observational study is to explore the evaluation of\\n  pegylated interferon \\u03b1-2b combined with first-line NAs on the long-term\\n  outcome of CHB antiviral therapy with cirrhosis and HCC progression as\\n  the main observation targets, compared with only use of NAs in the\\n  context of familial clusters of HBV infection with unfavorable\\n  prognoses. It is intended to provide high-quality evidence-based medical\\n  evidence for the treatment and follow-up of CHB, explore optimal\\n  clinical decision-making, and provide global clinical data for the\\n  improvement and evaluation of this difficult-to-treat population. The\\n  main question it aims to answer is: Can Peg IFN-\\u03b1-2B combined with NAs\\n  therapy improve the long-term outcomes of this particular population of\\n  familial clusters of HBV infection with unfavorable prognoses compared\\n  to first-line NAs monotherapy? Patients with familial clusters of HBV\\n  infection with unfavorable prognoses using Peg IFN-\\u03b1-2B combined with\\n  NAs therapy and NAs monotherapy will be collected laboratory and medical\\n  examination data at specified follow-up points, and recorded adverse\\n  events and drug combinations in detail for 7 years.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Hepatitis B, Chronic (CHB)|Hepatitis B|Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)\\nInterventions: DRUG: Peg IFN-\\u03b1-2b\\nPhases:\\nEnrollment: 1500\\nStudy Type: OBSERVATIONAL\\nStudy Design: Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p\\nStart Date: 2025-01-01\\nCompletion Date: 2032-01\\n\\n# Record 5\\nNct Number: NCT06441006\\nStudy Title:\\n  Program for Rifampicin-Resistant Disease With Stratified Medicine for\\n  Tuberculosis\\nStudy Url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06441006\\nStudy Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING\\nBrief Summary:\\n  PRISM-TB is an international, seamless, multicenter, open-label,\\n  randomized, controlled, pragmatic, stratified medicine, treatment\\n  shortening, multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS), noninferiority Phase 2/3\\n  clinical trial for fluoroquinolone-susceptible multidrug-\\n  resistant/rifampin-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (FQ-S MDR/RR-TB).

Despite the commonplace use of bronchodilator treatments, like\\n  albuterol, in conditions like asthma, their efficacy in bronchiolitis\\n  remains controversial due to the heterogeneity in patient response.\\n  Although studies indicate that bronchodilators do not enhance outcomes\\n  in bronchiolitis, meta-analyses can obscure the heterogeneity of\\n  treatment effects. While bronchodilator response genetics have not been\\n  explored in bronchiolitis, treatment effectiveness variations often\\n  depend on genomic factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have\\n  linked genetic variants with bronchodilator response and outcomes in\\n  childhood asthma, suggesting a bronchodilator-responsive genotype. This\\n  proposal aims to extend this paradigm to bronchiolitis, addressing the\\n  gap in knowledge where GWAS and clinical characteristics intersect. The\\n  proposed study's objective is to characterize phenotypic and genotypic\\n  variations of children with bronchiolitis and their association with\\n  bronchodilator response. We hypothesize that children with bronchiolitis\\n  who exhibit clinical and historical characteristics associated with\\n  atopy and specific physical findings have genetic variants linked to\\n  bronchodilator response. To achieve this, we propose to (Aim 1) define\\n  airway responsiveness to bronchodilator treatment in children with\\n  bronchiolitis using the change in respiratory score, (Aim 2a) identify\\n  the associations between candidate genetic variants and bronchodilator\\n  response among children with bronchiolitis, and (Aim 2b) determine the\\n  associations between candidate genetic variants and clinical patient\\n  data to identify bronchodilator-responsive children with bronchiolitis.\\n  A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a\\n  single albuterol dose in children aged 3 to 24 months presenting with\\n  bronchiolitis to the emergency department will be conducted to achieve\\n  these aims. Patient information and respiratory assessment outcomes will\\n  be collected before and after intervention. Blood, urine, DNA buccal\\n  swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs will also be collected. Completion of\\n  these aims will result in a novel clinical prediction model for\\n  bronchodilator response determination in bronchiolitis, integrating\\n  clinical, physical, and genetic data. Furthermore, this research\\n  supports the candidates' career development goals of advancing training\\n  in clinical trial research design and execution and becoming an expert\\n  in clinical and translational methods to enhance pediatric emergency\\n  department health and outcomes. Ultimately, this work will inform an R01\\n  application to validate an evidence-based prediction rule for\\n  identifying bronchodilator-responsive children with bronchiolitis\\n  through a multi-center emergency medicine research network, optimizing\\n  therapeutic approaches, and reducing resource use in those with a low\\n  likelihood of bronchodilator response.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Bronchiolitis|Bronchodilator Agents\\nInterventions:\\n  DRUG: Albuterol Sulfate, 2.5 Mg/3 mL (0.083%) Inhalation Solution|DRUG:\\n  Sodium Chloride 0.9% Inhl 3Ml\\nPhases: PHASE3\\nEnrollment: 400\\nStudy Type: INTERVENTIONAL\\nStudy Design:\\n  Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE\\n  (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT\\nStart Date: 2022-07-08\\nCompletion Date: 2030-12-31\\n\\n# Record 13\\nNct Number: NCT06619561\\nStudy Title:\\n  A Study to Evaluate Vimseltinib in Adults With Active Chronic Graft-\\n  Versus-Host Disease (cGVHD)\\nStudy Url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06619561\\nStudy Status: RECRUITING\\nBrief Summary:\\n  The purpose of this study is to determine if vimseltinib is safe,\\n  tolerable and works effectively to treat adults with active moderate to\\n  severe cGVHD.

Kidney transplantation is at the first rank of solid\\n  organ transplantation in France, with 3,376 grafts performed in 2022.\\n  Immunosuppressive therapy, required to prevent graft rejection, exposes\\n  graft recipients to complications related to decreased immunity,\\n  including opportunistic infections and neoplastic complications.\\n\\n  After the earlt post-transplantation period, up to 10% of kidney\\n  transplant recipients will require admission to the intensive care unit\\n  (ICU). The main reasons for admission are septic shock and acute\\n  hypoxemic respiratory failure. ICU stay has a significant impact on\\n  these patients with a mortality rate reaching 40%, that remains\\n  increased even after ICU discharge. Furthermore, an impact on graft\\n  function has been demonstrated, with deterioration of graft function in\\n  1/3 of patients, and among those, up to one in two will require\\n  resumption of renal replacement therapy (RRT).\\n\\n  Although the occurrence of septic shock or acute respiratory failure\\n  related to an infection is more common and severe, the optimal\\n  management strategy for immunosuppressors is not defined in kidney\\n  transplant recipients admitted to the ICU in those settings.\\n\\n  Maintain a high level of immunosuppressive therapies may hinder the\\n  recovery from the acute critical condition. Furthermore, these\\n  treatments have a narrow therapeutic index; for instance, the management\\n  of calcineurin inhibitors is challenging in the ICU due to\\n  pharmacodynamic changes associated with the acute situation\\n  (distribution volume, organ failure) and the numerous potential drug\\n  interactions that carry inherent risks of overdose.\\n\\n  the investigators hypothesize that a reduction in the level of\\n  immunosuppressive treatments could promote recovery in kidney transplant\\n  recipients admitted to the ICU for septic shock and/or acute hypoxemic\\n  respiratory failure, without adversely affecting the risk of rejection\\n  or long-term renal prognosis.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions:\\n  Sepsis and Septic Shock|Acute Respiratory Failure|Kidney Transplant\\n  Recipients|Immunosuppressive Agents\\nInterventions:\\n  DRUG: Hydrocortisone Hemisuccinate: 200 mg per day.|OTHER: reduction of\\n  the level of immunosuppression\\nPhases: PHASE4\\nEnrollment: 212\\nStudy Type: INTERVENTIONAL\\nStudy Design:\\n  Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking:\\n  NONE|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE\\nStart Date: 2025-06-01\\nCompletion Date: 2029-06-01\\n\\n# Record 18\\nNct Number: NCT06350448\\nStudy Title: Washed Microbiota Transplantation for Rhinitis\\nStudy Url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06350448\\nStudy Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING\\nBrief Summary:\\n  The common symptoms of rhinitis include nasal itching, sneezing,\\n  anterior or posterior nasal leakage, and nasal congestion.

China is\\n  among the countries with the highest TB burden, ranking third globally\\n  for total TB cases and second for drug-resistant TB cases. PAN-TB is an\\n  innovative concept in TB treatment, aiming to develop a universal\\n  regimen effective for all forms of active TB, including both drug-\\n  susceptible and drug-resistant strains. The primary goal of the PAN-TB\\n  regimen is to simplify the treatment process, reduce costs, and improve\\n  treatment success rates. The ideal Target Regimen Profile (TRP) for PAN-\\n  TB includes superior efficacy compared to standard treatment for non-\\n  drug-resistant TB, a reduced treatment duration from the current 4-6\\n  months to 2-3 months, and improved safety and tolerability. This project\\n  aims to explore a new ultra-short-course treatment regimen for both\\n  drug-sensitive (DS-TB) and drug-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB), which aligns\\n  with the latest trends in TB treatment both domestically and\\n  internationally. The regimen also has significant practical implications\\n  for enhancing treatment efficacy and reducing patient burden.\\n  Furthermore, the study will explore the identification of new biomarkers\\n  closely linked to treatment outcomes over the course of full-cycle\\n  therapy.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Pulmonary Tuberculosis\\nInterventions:\\n  DRUG: Bedaquiline (B)|DRUG: Sitafloxacin (S)|DRUG: Linezolid (L)|DRUG:\\n  Pyrazinamide (Z)|DRUG: Isoniazid (H)|DRUG: Rifampicin (R)|DRUG:\\n  Ethambutol (E)|DRUG: Moxifloxacin (M)|DRUG: Pretomanid (Pa)\\nPhases: PHASE3\\nEnrollment: 610\\nStudy Type: INTERVENTIONAL\\nStudy Design:\\n  Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking:\\n  NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT\\nStart Date: 2025-04-15\\nCompletion Date: 2029-12\\n\\n# Record 23\\nNct Number: NCT06576830\\nStudy Title: Optimization of Pediatric Tonsillectomy to IMprove AnaLgesia\\nStudy Url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06576830\\nStudy Status: RECRUITING\\nBrief Summary:\\n  The purpose of this study is to compare the use of short acting opioids\\n  (fentanyl/hydromorphone) with long acting opioids (methadone) for pain\\n  control following tonsillectomy surgery in children and adolescents.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions:\\n  Pain, Postoperative|Tonsillar Hypertrophy|Tonsillitis|Pediatric Sleep\\n  Apnea|Sleep-Disordered Breathing\\nInterventions: DRUG: Methadone|DRUG: Fentanyl/Hydromorphone\\nPhases: PHASE4\\nEnrollment: 440\\nStudy Type: INTERVENTIONAL\\nStudy Design:\\n  Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE\\n  (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose:\\n  TREATMENT\\nStart Date: 2024-11-21\\nCompletion Date: 2029-06-01\\n\\n# Record 24\\nNct Number: NCT06172660\\nStudy Title: Real-World Effectiveness of Perinatal RSV Immunoprophylaxis\\nStudy Url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06172660\\nStudy Status: RECRUITING\\nBrief Summary:\\n  The purpose of this study is to continue evaluating how well the RSV\\n  vaccines work as they are currently being used in routine clinical\\n  practice.

This treatment is\\n  an emergency medical treatment. The breathing tube is inserted into the\\n  patients' airway by either their mouth or neck. For patients who need\\n  assistance with their breathing from a mechanical ventilator, infections\\n  in the airways and lungs, known as pneumonia, are a common complication.\\n  Everyone naturally has bacteria in their mouth, esophagus and stomach.\\n  Clinicians think that during the process of inserting the breathing\\n  tube, small amounts of these bacteria can be introduced into the airways\\n  and lung when people are unconscious following an acute severe brain\\n  injury, or during the process of placing the breathing tube into the\\n  airways. These bacteria are now in a place they aren't meant to be and\\n  can cause an infections in the airways and lungs known as pneumonia.\\n\\n  The purpose of this research is to see if giving one dose of a common\\n  antibiotic can prevent patients developing pneumonia, which is\\n  associated with having a breathing tube inserted and being on a\\n  ventilator, improving the chance of recovery following the acute severe\\n  brain injury and ultimately improving the chance of surviving.\\n\\n  When patients have a known infection, current guidelines are to treat\\n  them with antibiotics. Antibiotics work to kill the bacteria causing the\\n  infection. When a patient has an infection in their lungs, they often\\n  need to stay on the mechanical ventilator for longer.

The current standard of care, trimethoprim-\\n  sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) at a dose of 15-20 mg/kg/day of TMP, is\\n  associated with serious adverse events, including hypersensitivity\\n  reactions, drug-induced liver injury, cytopenia, and renal failure\\n  occurring among 20-60% of patients. The frequency of adverse events\\n  increases in a dose dependent manner and commonly limits the use of TMP-\\n  SMX.\\n\\n  Reduced treatment doses of TMP-SMX for PJP reduced ADEs without\\n  mortality differences in a recent meta-analysis of observational\\n  studies. We therefore propose a Phase III randomized, placebo-controlled\\n  trial to directly compare the efficacy and safety of low dose (10\\n  mg/kg/day of TMP) compared to the standard-of-care (15 mg/kg/day) among\\n  patients with PJP for the primary outcome of death, new mechanical\\n  ventilation, and change of treatment.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions:\\n  Pneumocystis|Pneumocystis Pneumonia|Pneumocystis Jirovecii\\n  Infection|Pneumocystis Infections|Pneumocystis Carinii\\n  Infection|Pneumocystosis; Pneumonia (Etiology)|Pneumocystis Carinii;\\n  Infection, Resulting From HIV Disease|Pneumocystosis Associated With\\n  AIDS\\nInterventions: DRUG: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole|DRUG: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole\\nPhases: PHASE3\\nEnrollment: 300\\nStudy Type: INTERVENTIONAL\\nStudy Design:\\n  Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE\\n  (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary\\n  Purpose: TREATMENT\\nStart Date: 2025-01\\nCompletion Date: 2028-06\\n\\n# Record 36\\nNct Number: NCT04712539\\nStudy Title:\\n  Baloxavir and Oseltamivir for the Treatment of Severe Influenza\\n  Infection in Immunocompromised Patients\\nStudy Url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04712539\\nStudy Status: RECRUITING\\nBrief Summary:\\n  This phase II trial studies the effect of baloxavir in combination with\\n  oseltamivir in treating severe influenza infection in patients who have\\n  previously received a hematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplant or have\\n  a hematological malignancy.

While many individuals\\n  recover from the acute phase of the infection, a significant proportion\\n  continue to experience persistent and debilitating symptoms long after\\n  the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. This condition, known as Long COVID\\n  (LC) or sometimes referred to as Post-COVID Condition (PCC) or post-\\n  acute sequelae of COVID-19, has emerged as a complex multisystemic\\n  condition and challenging health issue, affecting approximately 10% of\\n  COVID-19 patients. Various symptoms characterize LC, including fatigue,\\n  sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and mood disturbances. Some of\\n  the symptoms are shared with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue\\n  Syndrome (ME/CFS) - a condition marked by debilitating fatigue and a\\n  host of other symptoms without precise biomarkers or objective tests for\\n  diagnosis. Effective LC treatments remain elusive and LC patients\\n  continue to grapple with persistent symptoms that significantly impact\\n  their quality of life. Given the lack of effective treatments, it is\\n  imperative to explore novel therapeutic approaches that may alleviate\\n  the suffering of this patient population.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Long COVID\\nInterventions: DRUG: Taurine|DRUG: Placebo\\nPhases: PHASE2|PHASE3\\nEnrollment: 300\\nStudy Type: INTERVENTIONAL\\nStudy Design:\\n  Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE\\n  (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary\\n  Purpose: TREATMENT\\nStart Date: 2025-10\\nCompletion Date: 2028-12\\n\\n# Record 40\\nNct Number: NCT07089719\\nStudy Title:\\n  Bevacizumab in Post-acute Sequelae of COVID-19 : Efficacy and Safety\\n  (Pilot Study)\\nStudy Url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07089719\\nStudy Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING\\nBrief Summary:\\n  The aim of this research is to evaluate an innovative treatment,\\n  Bevacizumab, in patients suffering from respiratory complications\\n  related to COVID-19. These complications, particularly difficulty\\n  breathing (dyspnea) and impaired lung function, are common in some\\n  individuals after infection. The study seeks to determine whether\\n  Bevacizumab can improve breathing capacity by acting on vascular\\n  mechanisms that may be responsible for these issues. A total of 21\\n  patients with these persistent symptoms will be included in the study,\\n  with close medical monitoring to assess both the effectiveness of the\\n  treatment and its safety.\\n\\n  This research aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of\\n  Bevacizumab, a medication known for its anti-angiogenic properties\\n  (which prevent the formation of new blood vessels), in patients\\n  experiencing persistent respiratory problems after COVID-19 infection.\\n  In other words, this research is based on the idea that inhibiting blood\\n  vessel formation with Bevacizumab may improve clinical outcomes in\\n  patients with severe forms of COVID-19 by reducing vascular\\n  complications associated with the infection.\\n\\n  To answer this research question, 21 individuals with persistent\\n  respiratory symptoms (significant dyspnea) and reduced lung diffusing\\n  capacity (DLCO less than 75% of the predicted value) at least three\\n  months after their initial COVID-19 infection will be included. The\\n  study is being conducted at H\\u00f4pital Europ\\u00e9en Georges Pompidou, in Paris.\\n\\n  The total expected duration of the research is 31 months, and each\\n  patient's participation will last 7 months, which includes 2 months of\\n  treatment (five Bevacizumab injections) followed by five additional\\n  months of medical follow-up.\\n\\n  In this research project, we will be evaluating Bevacizumab, an\\n  experimental drug in the context of Long COVID. Bevacizumab is a\\n  monoclonal antibody used to inhibit angiogenesis (the abnormal formation\\n  of new blood vessels). While commonly used in oncology, in this study,\\n  its use aims to improve lung function in patients suffering from\\n  persistent respiratory complications after COVID-19 infection.\\n\\n  Bevacizumab will be administered as an intravenous infusion. The\\n  infusion lasts between 30 and 90 minutes. The dosage is 10 mg/kg every\\n  two weeks, for a total of five infusions over a two-month period.\\n  Additional follow-up visits will be conducted one month and five months\\n  after the end of treatment. Monitoring will include clinical\\n  examinations, laboratory tests, and lung function assessments.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Dyspnea Caused by 2019-nCoV\\nInterventions: DRUG: Bevacizumab Injection\\nPhases: PHASE2\\nEnrollment: 21\\nStudy Type: INTERVENTIONAL\\nStudy Design:\\n  Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary\\n  Purpose: TREATMENT\\nStart Date: 2025-10-01\\nCompletion Date: 2028-05-01\\n\"}], \"isError\": false}"
